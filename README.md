<b>GameShop Engine</b>

A game development engine that uses Javaâ€™s LWJGL (LightWeight Java Game Library) and OpenGL.  This engine will specify its own format systems including its own 3d format and will have a wide range of features that make game development faster and more efficient.

Problem:
Other game engines have to rely on industry standards that do not have much flexibility.  They are based on fundamentals that do not allow for complex interactions to occur without heavy modification.
